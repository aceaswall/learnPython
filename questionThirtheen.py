# This is a question from the book "Automate The Boring Stuff" (Question 13 - Chapter 2)

#13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# for
#for i in range(0, 11):
#    print(i)

n = 0
while n < 11:
    print(n)
    n = n + 1
